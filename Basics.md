**CallBack:** A callback is a function that passed as an argument to another function.

**Asynchronous:** Asynchronous is a way to call/running multiple functions in parallelly.

**Promise:** Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
  Promises can be used to avoid chaining callbacks. 
  
  A Promise states:

    1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

    2. fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.

    3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
